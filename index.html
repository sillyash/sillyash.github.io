        Hi!
      </p>
      <p>
        I'm a student at Orsay's <span class="glossary-word">IUT</span>, from Paris-Saclay university, and I study computer science. I'm currently in an internship in the <span class="glossary-word">CNRS</span>, at <span class="glossary-word">IPSL</span>'s research center.

      <p>
        As you already, know, I'm studying CompSci at university, but I've been studying CompSci since my first year of highschool.
      </p>
      <p>
        I'm a french native speaker, but I'm quite fluent in English, sometimes even better in english when it comes to IT slang.
      </p>
      <p>
        I've learned a lot of Python and Java, but I'm also resourceful with JavaScript and Bash.
      </p>
      <p>
        I'm currently learning JavaScript, C, and PHP.
      </p>
      <p>
        As you have probably seen, I'm a curious person when it comes to languages, and I want to try a lot of them before I finish my studies. I'm a fast learner and I've noticed that it gets easier the more I learn.
      </p>
      <p>
        Of course, I'm not aiming to be a very good or expert developer in all of these languages, but learning the basics of a lot of languages might help me figure out which ones I want to work with in the long term.
      </p>
      <p>
        I'm getting quite good using C++ and it's libraries, but I'm also enjoying Java, which have two very different philosophies.
      </p>
      <p>
        Frontend developing is quite fun, but I really like backend. However, if I could, I'd choose to dev in fullstack and I wish to have the opportunity to learn about fullstack frameworks soon.
      </p>
      <p>
        I've done a lot of SQL and CDM/Database construction for school projects, as well as installing and setting up a MariaDB database on a Raspberry Pi to learn about DevOps.
      </p>
      <p>
        When it comes to my preferences, I would say I encourage and like Open Source and Free Software a lot, but I love to participate in anything interesting, really.
      </p>
      <p>
        I'm both a Windows and GNU/Linux user, and I try to keep up with freedom, security and privacy when it comes to technology: that's why I'm using Debian/Kali and Arch/Manjaro a lot.
      </p>
      <p>
        Concerning the OS I use, I use GNU/linux daily on my laptop, and use Windows on my desktop at home. I use the shell on both computers, so I'm comfortable with PowerShell and Bash (sh/zsh).
