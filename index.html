        Hi!
      </p>
      <p>
        I'm Ashley, a student at Orsay's IUT, from Paris-Saclay university, 
        and I study computer science. I'm currently in an internship in the 
        CNRS, at IPSL's research center.
      </p>
      <p>
        As you already, know, I'm studying CompSci at university, but I've 
        been studying CompSci since my first year of highschool.
      </p>
      <p>
        I'm a french native speaker, but I'm quite fluent in English, 
        sometimes even better in english when it comes to IT slang.
      </p>
      <p>
        I've learned a lot of Python and <b>Java</b>, but I'm 
        also resourceful with <b>JavaScript</b> and Bash.
      </p>
      <p>
        I'm currently learning <b>JavaScript</b>, <b>C</b>, and <b>PHP</b>.
      </p>
      <p>
        As you have probably seen, I'm a curious person when it comes to languages, 
        and I want to try a lot of them before I finish my studies. I'm a fast 
        learner and I've noticed that it gets easier the more I learn.
      </p>
      <p>
        Of course, I'm not aiming to be a very good or expert developer in all of 
        these languages, but learning the basics of a lot of languages might help 
        me figure out which ones I want to work with in the long term.
      </p>
      <p>
        I'm getting quite good using <b>C++</b> and it's libraries, but I'm 
        also enjoying <b>Java</b>, which have two very different philosophies.
      </p>
      <p>
        Frontend developing is quite fun, but I really like backend. However, if 
        I could, I'd choose to dev in fullstack and I wish to have the opportunity 
        to learn about fullstack frameworks soon.
      </p>
      <p>
        I've done a lot of <b>SQL</b> and <b>CDM/Database</b> construction for 
        school projects, as well as installing and setting up a <b>MariaDB</b> 
        database on a <b>Raspberry Pi</b> to learn about <b>DevOps</b>.
      </p>
      <p>
        When it comes to my preferences, I would say I encourage and like Open 
        Source and Free Software a lot, but I love to participate in anything 
        interesting, really.
      </p>
      <p>
        I'm both a Windows and <b>GNU/Linux</b> user, and I try to keep up 
        with freedom, security and privacy when it comes to technology: that's 
        why I'm using <b>Debian/Kali</b> and <b>Arch/Manjaro</b> a lot.
      </p>
      <p>
        Concerning the OS I use, I use <b>GNU/Linux</b> daily on my laptop, 
        and use Windows on my desktop at home. I use the shell on both 
        computers, so I'm comfortable with <b>PowerShell</b> and <b>Bash</b> 
        (sh/zsh).
