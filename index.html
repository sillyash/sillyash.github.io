        Hi!
      </p>
      <p>
        I'm Ashley, a student at Orsay's IUT, from Paris-Saclay university, and I study computer science. I'm currently in an internship in the CNRS, at IPSL's research center.
      </p>
      <p>
        As you already, know, I'm studying CompSci at university, but I've been studying CompSci since my first year of highschool.
      </p>
      <p>
        I'm a french native speaker, but I'm quite fluent in English, sometimes even better in english when it comes to IT slang.
      </p>
      <p>
        I've learned a lot of Python and <b>Java</b>, but I'm also resourceful with <b>JavaScript</b> and Bash.
      </p>
      <p>
        I'm currently learning <b>JavaScript</b>, <b>C</b>, and <b>PHP</b>.
      </p>
      <p>
        As you have probably seen, I'm a curious person when it comes to languages, and I want to try a lot of them before I finish my studies. I'm a fast learner and I've noticed that it gets easier the more I learn.
      </p>
      <p>
        Of course, I'm not aiming to be a very good or expert developer in all of these languages, but learning the basics of a lot of languages might help me figure out which ones I want to work with in the long term.
      </p>
      <p>
        I'm getting quite good using <b>C++</b> and it's libraries, but I'm also enjoying <b>Java</b>, which have two very different philosophies.
      </p>
      <p>
        Frontend developing is quite fun, but I really like backend. However, if I could, I'd choose to dev in fullstack and I wish to have the opportunity to learn about fullstack frameworks soon.
      </p>
      <p>
        I've done a lot of <b>SQL</b> and <b>CDM/Database</b> construction for school projects, as well as installing and setting up a <b>MariaDB</b> database on a <b>Raspberry Pi</b> to learn about <b>DevOps</b>.
      </p>
      <p>
        When it comes to my preferences, I would say I encourage and like Open Source and Free Software a lot, but I love to participate in anything interesting, really.
      </p>
      <p>
        I'm both a Windows and <b>GNU/Linux</b> user, and I try to keep up with freedom, security and privacy when it comes to technology: that's why I'm using <b>Debian/Kali</b> and <b>Arch/Manjaro</b> a lot.
      </p>
      <p>
        Concerning the OS I use, I use <b>GNU/Linux</b> daily on my laptop, and use Windows on my desktop at home. I use the shell on both computers, so I'm comfortable with <b>PowerShell</b> and <b>Bash</b> (sh/zsh).
      </p>

          I have, and I've always had a lot of hobbies simulteanously. However, the hobbies that I stuck with are the precious ones and I cherish them for existing.

          Okay, so first of all <span class="shakey">MUSIC.</span> but that has it's own section here, because my life revolves around it. I could be making an entire other website to talk about it.
